**Telangana Growth Analysis & Economic Insights Dashboard | Power BI**

**Project Overview**

This project presents a multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Telangana’s economic performance using public government datasets.

The dashboard integrates:

* 📜 Stamp Revenue Data
* 🚗 Transport & Vehicle Registrations
* 🏭 Industrial Investment (TS-iPASS)
* 👷 Employment Generation
* 🗺 District-wise & Regional Analysis

The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making and policy planning.

**🎯 Problem Statement**

Telangana generates significant revenue and industrial growth across districts. However, data is distributed across departments and years, making it difficult to:

* Track year-wise growth trends
* Compare district-level performance
* Analyze investment impact on employment
* Study mobility patterns
* Understand revenue concentration

This project builds an integrated analytical dashboard to centralize and visualize these insights.

**🎯 Objectives**

* Analyze total stamp revenue across years and districts
* Identify top and low-performing districts
* Evaluate industrial investment and employment generation
* Study transport and mobility patterns
* Compare revenue, investment, and employment performance
* Enable interactive filtering and drill-down analysis

🛠**Tools & Technologies Used**

* Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development
* Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation (ETL)
* DAX – KPI calculations & dynamic measures
* CSV Datasets – Telangana Open Data
* Bing Maps (Power BI Map Visual) – Geographic visualization
